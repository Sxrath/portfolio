    <h3>ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
    <p>I am Sarathkrishnan PR, and I am enthusiastic about pursuing a career in Information Technology. My goal is to join a dynamic and forward-thinking company where I can contribute to its growth while continuously enhancing my skills and knowledge.

        I completed my B.C.A from the College of Applied Science Chelakkara (IHRD). Prior to that, I successfully completed my 12th grade at GHSS, Cheruthuruthy, and my 10th grade at GHSS Panjal. During my academic journey, I also had the privilege of being an NSS Volunteer and participating in a 7-day camp, which was a rewarding experience.
        
        Outside of academics, I have a passion for music, and I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres. Additionally, I love playing cricket, which not only keeps me active but also teaches me valuable lessons about teamwork and sportsmanship.
        
        When it comes to personal skills, I consider myself a good team player with strong leadership abilities. I believe in active listening and continuous learning, which helps me adapt to new challenges effectively. I take pride in being a smart worker who seeks innovative solutions to problems.
        
        In terms of languages, I am proficient in English, Malayalam, and I have developed skills in programming languages such as Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. These technical skills have equipped me to explore and excel in the field of Information Technology.
        
        Overall, I am dedicated to personal and professional growth, and I look forward to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to a forward-looking organization in the IT sector.</p>
